# n-queens

The n-queens problem is this: Can `n` queens be placed on an n by n chessboard
such that none of them can attack another? The answer, proved by E. Pauls in
the late 1800s, is yes, for n = 1 and n > 3.

This repo is a collection of solutions to the n-queens problem, and a short set
of LaTeX notes on the solutions.
